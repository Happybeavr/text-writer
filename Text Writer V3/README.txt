Thanks for using my program. -Jason

Welcome to the text writer ahk program! This short readme file will contain what you need to know
to use this program.

To start, you wanna open Paint. Simplest way to do that is to type "paint" into the search bar
and press enter. Once it opens, maximize the window.

Then press the key combo CTRL+1. In this window you can enter the text for the program to draw in Paint. Make sure your input does not use too many characters,
or the program may attempt to write off your screen.

Finally, to run the program, press the key combo CTRL+` (the key at the top left of your keyboard with the squiggly line on it).

Easter eggs:

Typing "doge" into the text bar will draw a pixel doge face to look at you with disappointment.

Typing "yoshi egg" into the text bar will draw a pixellated Yoshi egg. Things to note about this part of the program: The picture it will attempt to draw is very large.
When you want to use it, make sure you maximize the Paint window, make the canvas very large by dragging on the corners of the white area, and place your cursor very 
close to the top of the canvas. Then press the draw hotkey.

If, for some reason, you want the program to write out the words "doge" or "yoshi egg" just add a space at the end. i.e. "yoshi egg "

IMPORTANT!!!! 

If the program starts going haywire, or you accidentally run it without Paint open,
press your RIGHT SHIFT KEY to reload the program.
